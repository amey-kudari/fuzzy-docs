# Fuzzy docs

Built primarily for javascript ecma docs.
Search anything

### Example,

Lets say we are searching for reduceRight in javascript, and I want to see the official docs for it,
<img width="1728" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41bdafc7-bfcb-4e71-afe6-89568dc1008b">

We can see that in the official website also by doing ctrl + f, what is different here?
Lets say I made a spelling mistake, or I remembered something somewhat but not the exact word, for example, if I made a spelling mistake, ill still see it
<img width="1722" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55ec9380-0735-4ea1-872b-8c1edb05e452">

The main thing is official website takes a lot of time to load the entire huge html doc. This website solves both issues, speed and fuzzy search within docs.
